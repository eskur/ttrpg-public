# House Rules
- Be respectful of everyone.
- Be patient.
- If you are significantly late, you won't be able to play the session.
- Let me know ahead of time if you can't make the session.

## Game modifications
### XP
- Advancement XP (AXP) is awarded at the end of each session. 
- Benefits XP (BXP) is awarded for GM intrusions, discoveries, etc.
- **Benefits XP cannot be spent on advancements.**
- Benefits XP can be spent on rerolls, short/medium/long term benefits, etc.
- As characters tier up, they require more advancements to reach the next tier.

| Tier   | Advancements |
| ------ | ------------ | 
| 1 -> 2 | 4            |
| 2 -> 3 | 5            |
| 3 -> 4 | 5            |
| 4 -> 5 | 6            |
| 5 -> 6 | 6            |

- Alternative salvage rules are used (credit to @Maelfectious#9513)
- All characters who are unskilled in Numenera count as untrained. (They do not have an inability).

### Game Flow
- *Let it Ride*: You may not reroll a task **unless**: you spend 1BXP, the situation changes, or you use a different approach.

### Character creation
You may use any material from the Numenera or Cypher books, with the exception of:
- Focus: Travels through Time

If you would like to use something from other settings published by MCG, let me know can we can reskin it for Numenera.

- If you write a decent backstory for your character, you start with +2 XP (one time)
- At the start each session, if you write a character goal, you get +1 XP

#### Mutations
I don't use the mutant descriptor. Anyone can have mutations, but they have costs.

When creating a character with mutations, first pick a different descriptor. Then, work with your GM to exchange abilities from that descriptor for AXP. You may randomly roll for standard cost, or chose mutations for a higher cost. During character creation you may use AXP from other sources to buy mutations.

| Descriptor Ability Type | AXP Cost |
| -----------------------:| --------:|
| +2 to Pool              | 2        |
| +4 to Pool              | 4        |
| Narrow Skill            | 2        |
| Narrow Inability        | -2       |
| Broad Skill             | 4        |
| Broad Inability         | -4       |
| Unique Ability          | 4        |

| Mutation Type | AXP Cost (Rolled) | AXP Cost (Chosen) | Limit |
| ------------- | -----------------:| -----------------:| -----:|
| Cosmetic      | 0                 | 0                 | 4     |
| Beneficial    | 2                 | 3                 | 4     |
| Powerful      | 4                 | 6                 | 2     |
| Distinctive   | 4                 | 6                 | 2     |
| Harmful       | -4                | -2                | 2     |

Some mutations may need mechanical modifications if they impact character interactions.
