# House Rules
- Be respectful of everyone.
- Be patient.
- If you are significantly late, you won't be able to play the session.
- Let me know ahead of time if you can't make the session.
- If there is an updated version of something (type, focus, descriptor, ability, cypher, artifact, etc), you must use the most recent version.
