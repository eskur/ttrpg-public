# House Rules
- Be respectful of everyone.
- Be patient.
- If you are significantly late, you won't be able to play the session.
- Let me know ahead of time if you can't make the session.

## Game modifications
### XP
- Advancement XP (AXP) is awarded at the end of each session. 
- Benefits XP (BXP) is awarded for GM intrusions, discoveries, etc.
- **Benefits XP cannot be spent on advancements.**
- Benefits XP can be spent on rerolls, short/medium/long term benefits, etc.
- As characters tier up, they require more advancements to reach the next tier.

| Tier   | Advancements |
| ------ | ------------ | 
| 1 -> 2 | 4            |
| 2 -> 3 | 5            |
| 3 -> 4 | 5            |
| 4 -> 5 | 6            |
| 5 -> 6 | 6            |

- Alternative salvage rules are used (credit to @Maelfectious#9513)
- All characters who are unskilled in Numenera count as untrained. (They do not have an inability).

### Game Flow
- *Let it Ride*: You may not reroll a task **unless**: you spend 1BXP, the situation changes, or you use a different approach.

### Character creation
You may use any material from the Numenera or Cypher books, with the exception of:
- Focus: Travels through Time

If you would like to use something from other settings published by MCG, let me know can we can reskin it for Numenera.

- If you write a decent backstory for your character, you start with +2 XP (one time)
- At the start each session, if you write a character goal, you get +1 XP
