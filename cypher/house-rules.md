# House Rules
- Be respectful of everyone.
- Be patient.
- If you are significantly late, you won't be able to play the session.
- Let me know ahead of time if you can't make the session.
- If there is an updated version of a piece of content (type, focus, descriptor, etc), you must use the updated version.

# Game modifications
## XP
- Advancement XP (AXP) is awarded at the end of each session. The amount is up to the GM. 
- Benefits XP (BXP) is awarded for GM intrusions, discoveries, etc.
- **Benefits XP cannot be spent on advancements.**
- Benefits XP can be spent on rerolls, short/medium/long term benefits, etc.
- Advancement XP may be used as Benefits XP (although this is probably a last resort).

### Benefit XP Sources
| Source                                   | BXP | Limit            | Notes                                           |

### Advancements
As characters tier up, they require more advancements to reach the next tier.

| Tier   | Advancements Needed |
| ------ | -------------------:|
| 1 to 2 | 4                   |
| 2 to 3 | 5                   |
| 3 to 4 | 5                   |
| 4 to 5 | 6                   |
| 5 to 6 | 6                   |

## Tasks
- *Let it Ride*: You may not reroll a task **unless**: you spend 1BXP, the situation changes, or you use a different approach. Additionally, a task can be attempted a maximum of three times.

## Numenera
- All characters who are unskilled in Numenera count as untrained. (They do not have an inability).
### Alternative salvage rules 
*credit to @Maelfectious#9513*

- Each player may attempt to salvage a Numenera salvage site independently **one time**.
- Results are determined by rolling on result tables.

## Character creation
You may use any material from the Numenera or Cypher books, with the exception of:
- Focus: Travels through Time

If you would like to use something from other settings published by MCG, let me know can we can reskin it for Numenera.

If you write a decent backstory for your character, you get +4 AXP (one time).

### Mutations
The mutant descriptor is not used. Anyone can have mutations, but they have costs.

When creating a character with mutations, first pick a different descriptor. Then work with your GM to exchange abilities from that descriptor for AXP. You may randomly roll mutations for standard cost, or chose mutations for a higher cost. During character creation you may use AXP from other sources to buy mutations.

| Descriptor Ability Type  | AXP Cost  |
| -----------------------: | --------: |
| +2 to Pool               | 2         |
| +4 to Pool               | 4         |
| -2 to Pool               | -2        |
| -4 to Pool               | -4        |
| Narrow Skill             | 2         |
| Narrow Inability         | -2        |
| Broad Skill              | 4         |
| Broad Inability          | -4        |
| Unique Ability           | 4         |

| Mutation Type | AXP Cost (Random) | AXP Cost (Chosen) | Limit |
| ------------- | -----------------:| -----------------:| -----:|
| Cosmetic      | 0                 | 0                 | 4     |
| Beneficial    | 2                 | 3                 | 4     |
| Powerful      | 4                 | 6                 | 2     |
| Distinctive   | 4                 | 6                 | 2     |
| Harmful       | -4                | -2                | 2     |

Some mutations may need mechanical modifications if they impact character interactions.
