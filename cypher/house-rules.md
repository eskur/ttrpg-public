# House Rules
- Be respectful of everyone.
- Be patient.
- If you are significantly late, you won't be able to play the session.
- Let me know ahead of time if you can't make the session.
- If there is an updated version of something (type, focus, descriptor, cypher, artifact, etc), you must use the most recent version.

# Game modifications
## XP
- Advancement XP (AXP) is awarded at the end of each session. The amount is up to the GM. 
- Story Points (SP) are awarded for GM intrusions, discoveries, etc.
- **Story Points cannot be spent on advancements.**
- Story Points can be spent on rerolls, short/medium/long term benefits, etc.
- Advancement XP may be used as Story Points (although this is probably a last resort).

| Story Points Sources                     | SP  | Limit            | Notes                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| GM Intrusion                             | 1   |                  | The group SP pool also gets 1                   |
| Discovery: Artifact                      | 1+  |                  | Split among group, artifact level / players     |
| Discovery: Purpose of an installation    | 1+  |                  | Split among group, installation level / players |
| Discovery: Strange                       | 1   |                  | Split among group                               |
| Writing a character goal                 | 1   | Once per session |                                                 |
| Making progress towards a character goal | 1   | Once per session |                                                 |
| Completing a character goal              | 2+  | Once per session |                                                 |

### Advancements
As characters tier up, they require more advancements to reach the next tier.

| Tier   | Advancements Needed |
| ------ | -------------------:|
| 1 to 2 | 4                   |
| 2 to 3 | 5                   |
| 3 to 4 | 5                   |
| 4 to 5 | 6                   |
| 5 to 6 | 6                   |

## Tasks
- *Let it Ride*: You may not reroll a task **unless**: you spend 1SP, the situation changes, or you use a different approach. Additionally, a task can be attempted a maximum of three times.

### Graduated Success
Some tasks may have an open difficulty. *See Discovery pg323, CSR pg417*
Graduated tasks are declared beforehand by the GM.

### Bargains with the Outside
You make a bargain with the Outside. They will help you succeed where you would have failed, for a price.

If you fail a task by less than half the target number, you can accept a GM intrusion for no SP to succeed at the task. 

Narrate how you narrowly snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

## Initiative
*There is no initiative (roll).*

- **Initiative is based on the current state of the fiction.** 
- The players go first if they are acting with advantage, surprise, or initiative. 
- If the players are reacting, surprised, or at a disadvantage, the NPC's go first. 
- If neither side has an advantage the group can either: spend 2SP to go first, or roll a d20. On 11+ the players go first.
- All the players act, then all the NPC's act.
- During the players' turn, players take actions as they make sense in the fiction. 

## Numenera
- All characters who are unskilled in Numenera count as untrained. (They do not have an inability).

### Alternative salvage rules 
*credit to @Maelfectious#9513 for salvaging overhaul*

Each player may attempt to salvage the same Numenera salvage site **one time**, then it is depleted for that player.


#### Steps
- The player declares if they are salvaging for Iotum or Cyphers
- The GM sets the maximum difficulty. Either the salvage target's level, or one chosen by the GM.
- The player rolls a graduated task, which may not exceed the maximum task difficulty.
- The GM rolls a number of times on the salvage table corresponding to the difficulty the player succeeded at. (consult the following table.)

| Player's Natural Roll | Salvage Table Rolls | Extra Effect |
| --------------------: | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 1-4                   | 1                   |              |
| 5-10                  | 2                   |              |
| 11-18                 | 3                   |              |
| 19                    | 3                   | Minor        |
| 20                    | 3                   | Major        |

| Extra Effects                                                     | Type  | SP Cost  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------: |
| Double the Iotum or Cyphers                                       | Minor | 0        |
| A random cypher                                                   | Minor | 0        |
| A roll on a random salvage table (roll a d10 to decide which one) | Minor | 0        |
| Reroll any salvage result (roll again on the same table)          | Minor | 0        |
| Roll on the salvage table for the next difficulty level           | Minor | 0        |
| Increase a Cypher level by 1                                      | Minor | 0        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------: |
| Gain a random artifact                                            | Major | 3        |
| Gain 5d20 Iotum                                                   | Major | 2        |
| Gain 3d6km (keep middle) of a specific Iotum (GM's choice)        | Major | 2        |
| Find a random plan                                                | Major | 2        |
| Find a specific plan                                              | Major | 3        |

#### Examples
- A player is salvaging a rich salvage site. The GM declares it has maximum difficulty of 7. The player rolls a 15 and is specialized in salvaging, which beats difficulty 7. The player rolls 3 times on salvage table 7.
- After defeating a level 6 automaton, the player goes to salvage it. The maximum difficulty is 6. The player rolls a 9, and is trained in salvaging, which beats difficulty 4. The player rolls 2 times on salvage table 4.
- The group finds a level 3 installation, and the player salvages it. The maximum difficulty is 3. The player rolls a 20, and is specialized in salvaging, which beats difficulty 8. The player rolls 3 times on salvage table 3, and gets a major effect.

#### Salvage Result Table (Cyphers)
| DL | Cyphers | Shins | Parts |
| 1  | 0       | 3d4kl | 3d4kl |
| 2  | 0       | 3d4km | 3d4km |
| 3  | 1       | 3d6km | 3d6km |
| 4  | 2       | 2d6   | 2d6   |
| 5  | 3       | 3d6   | 3d6   |

| 9  | 7       | 7d6   | 7d6   |
| 10 | 8       | 8d6   | 8d6   |

## Character creation
**If you write a decent backstory for your character, you get +4 AXP (one time). See the character Prompts section.**

You may use any material from the Numenera or Cypher System books, with the exception of:

- Focus: Travels through Time

If you would like to use something from other settings published by MCG, let me know can we can reskin it for Numenera.

### Mutations
The mutant descriptor is not used. Anyone can have mutations, but they have costs.

When creating a character with mutations, first pick a different descriptor. Then work with your GM to exchange abilities from that descriptor for AXP. You may randomly roll mutations for standard cost, or chose mutations for a higher cost. During character creation you may use AXP from other sources to buy mutations.

| Descriptor Ability Type  | AXP Cost  |
| -----------------------: | --------: |
| +2 to Pool               | 2         |
| +4 to Pool               | 4         |
| -2 to Pool               | -2        |
| -4 to Pool               | -4        |
| Narrow Skill             | 2         |
| Narrow Inability         | -2        |
| Broad Skill              | 4         |
| Broad Inability          | -4        |
| Unique Ability           | 4         |

| Mutation Type | AXP Cost (Random) | AXP Cost (Chosen) | Limit |
| ------------- | -----------------:| -----------------:| -----:|
| Cosmetic      | 0                 | 0                 | 4     |
| Beneficial    | 2                 | 3                 | 4     |
| Powerful      | 4                 | 6                 | 2     |
| Distinctive   | 4                 | 6                 | 2     |
| Harmful       | -4                | -2                | 2     |

Some mutations may need mechanical modifications if they impact character interactions.
