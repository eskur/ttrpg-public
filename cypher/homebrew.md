# Game modifications

# Experience

XP now has two two forms, Advancement Points (AP), and story points (SP). 

## Overview
- Advancement Points (AP) are awarded at the discretion of the GM. Usually this is after each session.
- Story Points (SP) are gained from the triggers in the table below.
- **Story Points cannot be spent on advancements.**
- Story Points can be spent on rerolls, short/medium/long term benefits, etc.
- Advancement Points can be used as Story Points (although this is probably a last resort).
- A character can have up to 10 combined SP. SP earned beyond that is discarded.

*GM Note: Consider giving out AP for completing milestones / character arcs. See CSR pg238*

The costs for some non-advancement benefits have been modified. In general, short-term and medium-term benefits have been reduced in cost to make them worth getting. There are also some new ways to spend SP.

**This is not an exhaustive list, if you have an idea for something not on this list feel free to suggest it.**

### GM Intrusions

GM Intrusions now award 1SP to the player, and 1SP to the group SP pool. With the
permission of the group, a player can use SP from the group pool.

### Advancements
- Advancements cost 4 AP. 
- As characters tier up, they require more advancements to reach the next tier.

| Tier   | Advancements Needed |
| ------ | -------------------:|
| 1 to 2 | 4                   |
| 2 to 3 | 5                   |
| 3 to 4 | 5                   |
| 4 to 5 | 6                   |
| 5 to 6 | 6                   |

#### Types of advancements

**Each of these can be chosen once per tier.**

| Name                     | Effect                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Increasing Capabilities  | +4 to a Pool                                |

See [Character Creation](https://github.com/eskur/ttrpg-public/blob/master/cypher/character-creation.md) for more information on gaining mutations.

# Tasks
*Let it Ride*: You can reattempt a failed task under the following circumstances: 

- you have an ability that allows it such as late inspiration
- you try a different approach 
- you spend 1SP
- the situation changes

**Note: this means you cannot attempt a task again in the same way by applying effort.**

Additionally, each task can be attempted a maximum of three times.


### Graduated Success
Graduated tasks are rolled with no difficulty, and the difficulty passed determines the quality of the outcome. These are often called *"open"* rolls.

Graduated tasks are always declared beforehand by the GM.

*Also see Discovery pg323, CSR pg417*

#### Example

Neva's group is delving in an ancient Numenera ruin. Neva takes the lead, and as she enters a new room, the GM asks for a graduated perception roll. 

Depending on what difficulty Neva's roll passes, she might:
- Spot none of the traps. 
- Spot a some of the traps. 
- Spot all the traps.
- Spot all the traps, and get an advantage (an asset on a future task for example). 

### Bargains with the Outside (Partial success & Converting failures)
You make a bargain with the Outside. They will help you succeed where you would have failed, for a price. If you fail a task by one difficulty step, you can accept a GM intrusion for no SP to succeed at the task. If you refuse this intrusion, pay 2SP.

Narrate how you narrowly snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. What happens that is unexpected?

#### Example

Falnor (played by Jake) is adventuring with Neva in a desert. They come across an ancient tower making a low humming noise. Around it are dead trees and a dried up riverbed.

**Falnor**: I go over to the tower and investigate. Can I figure out what it does, and how it works?

**GM**: I'm going to call that a difficulty 6 Numenera Understanding task, go for it.

*Jake rolls a 15, which passes difficulty 5. Almost!*

**GM**: You can tell you are close. The design appears highly advanced. You can see there are some sections with power, and others that are dark. Would you like to Bargain with the Outside?

**Jake**: Yeah, I want to figure this out. What's the bargain?

**GM**: I think the machine is missing some key parts. It is trying to start up again, and if it gets far enough in the start up sequence without those parts something catastrophic will happen. Got any ideas for that?

**Jake**: Maybe it activates is a burst? All the power gets consumed in one go, and the machine is fried.

**GM**: I like it. So how does Falnor figure out how the machine works?

**Falnor**: As I'm poking around the panels on the machine I see a button with a familiar word. I push it, the interface changes, and I can read it now. What can I see on the status display?

**GM**: The tower seems to be a weather control device. It used to maintain the area around it as an oasis. You can tell it is trying to start up again, and the power limiter is missing. If you wait too long it will go haywire. At the top right of the screen there a progress bar that reads "STARTUP 73%, ESTIMATED TIME REMAINING: 24 MINUTES".

**GM**: What do you do?

### Skills
- All characters who are unskilled in Numenera count as untrained. They do not have an inability.
- Healing is always a graduated roll. For example, a player rolls a tasking task and passes difficulty 4. They heal 4 points.

# Initiative

**There is no initiative (roll).**

- **Initiative is based on the current state of the fiction.** 
- The players go first if they are acting with advantage, surprise, or initiative. 
- If the players are reacting, surprised, or at a disadvantage, the NPC's go first. 
- If neither side has an advantage the players can either: spend 2SP to go first, or roll a d20. On 11+ the players go first.
- During the players' turn, players negotiate and take actions as they make sense in the fiction. 
- NPC's may act once per round at the discretion of the GM, usually in reaction to player actions.
- A round finishes when all participants have acted.
- If a player takes their turn last during a round, they cannot go first in the next round.
