# Game modifications
## XP
- Advancement XP (AXP) are awarded at the end of each session. The amount is up to the GM. 
- Story Points (SP) are awarded for GM intrusions, discoveries, etc.
- **Story Points cannot be spent on advancements.**
- Story Points can be spent on rerolls, short/medium/long term benefits, etc.
- Advancement XP may be used as Story Points (although this is probably a last resort).
- A character can have up to 10 combined AXP/SP. AXP/SP earned beyond that is discarded.

*Note: Also consider giving out AXP for completing milestones / character arcs. See CSR pg238*

### Intrusions

Intrusions now award 1SP to the player, and 1SP to the group SP pool. With the
permission of the group, a player may use SP from the group pool.

### Advancements
As characters tier up, they require more advancements to reach the next tier.

| Tier   | Advancements Needed |
| ------ | -------------------:|
| 1 to 2 | 4                   |
| 2 to 3 | 5                   |
| 3 to 4 | 5                   |
| 4 to 5 | 6                   |
| 5 to 6 | 6                   |

In addition to the current options for advancement, characters may buy mutations as advancements. See [Character Creation](https://github.com/eskur/ttrpg-public/blob/master/cypher/character-creation.md) 

## Tasks
*Let it Ride*: You may not reroll a task **unless**: you spend 1SP, the situation changes, or you use a different approach. Additionally, a task can be attempted a maximum of three times.

### Graduated Success
Some tasks may have an open difficulty. *See Discovery pg323, CSR pg417*
Graduated tasks are declared beforehand by the GM.

### Bargains with the Outside
You make a bargain with the Outside. They will help you succeed where you would have failed, for a price. If you fail a task by less than half the target number, you can accept a GM intrusion for no SP to succeed at the task. Narrate how you narrowly snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

## Skills
- All characters who are unskilled in Numenera count as untrained. (They do not have an inability).
- Healing is always a graduated roll. For example, a player rolls a tasking task and passes difficulty 4. They heal 4 points.

## Initiative
*There is no initiative (roll).*

- **Initiative is based on the current state of the fiction.** 
- The players go first if they are acting with advantage, surprise, or initiative. 
- If the players are reacting, surprised, or at a disadvantage, the NPC's go first. 
- If neither side has an advantage the players can either: spend 2SP to go first, or roll a d20. On 11+ the players go first.
- During the players' turn, players negotiate and take actions as they make sense in the fiction. 
- NPC's may act once per round according to GM fiat, usually in reaction to player actions.
- A round finishes when all participants have acted.
- If a player takes their turn last during a round, they cannot go first in the next round.
