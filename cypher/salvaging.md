# Salvaging
*credit to @Maelfectious#9513 for salvaging overhaul*

**Note: this system is still in flux, and may be changed frequently. (2020-03-30)**

Each player may attempt to salvage the same Numenera salvage site **one time**, then it is depleted for that player.

#### Steps
- The player declares if they are salvaging for Iotum or Cyphers
- The GM sets the maximum difficulty. Either the salvage target's level, or one chosen by the GM.
- The player rolls a graduated task, which may not exceed the maximum task difficulty.
- The GM rolls a number of times on the salvage table corresponding to the difficulty the player succeeded at. (consult the following table.)

| Player's Natural Roll | Salvage Table Rolls | Extra Effect |
| --------------------: | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 1-4                   | 1                   |              |
| 5-10                  | 2                   |              |
| 11-18                 | 3                   |              |
| 19                    | 3                   | Minor        |
| 20                    | 3                   | Major        |

| Extra Effects                                                     | Type  | SP Cost  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------: |
| Double the Iotum or Cyphers                                       | Minor | 0        |
| A random cypher                                                   | Minor | 0        |
| A roll on a random salvage table (roll a d10 to decide which one) | Minor | 0        |
| Reroll any salvage result (roll again on the same table)          | Minor | 0        |
| Roll on the salvage table for the next difficulty level           | Minor | 0        |
| Increase a Cypher level by 1                                      | Minor | 0        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------: |

| Gain 5d20 Iotum                                                   | Major | 2        |
| Gain 3d6km (keep middle) of a specific Iotum (GM's choice)        | Major | 2        |
| Find a random plan                                                | Major | 2        |
| Find a specific plan                                              | Major | 3        |

#### Examples
- A player is salvaging a rich salvage site. The GM declares it has maximum difficulty of 7. The player rolls a 15 and is specialized in salvaging, which beats difficulty 7. The player rolls 3 times on salvage table 7.
- After defeating a level 6 automaton, the player goes to salvage it. The maximum difficulty is 6. The player rolls a 9, and is trained in salvaging, which beats difficulty 4. The player rolls 2 times on salvage table 4.
- The group finds a level 3 installation, and the player salvages it. The maximum difficulty is 3. The player rolls a 20, and is specialized in salvaging, which beats difficulty 8. The player rolls 3 times on salvage table 3, and gets a major effect.
