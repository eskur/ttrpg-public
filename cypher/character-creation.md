## Character creation
**If you write a decent backstory for your character, you get +4 AXP (one time). See the character Prompts section.**

You may use any material from the Numenera or Cypher System books, with the exception of:

- Focus: Travels through Time

If you would like to use something from other settings published by MCG, let me know can we can reskin it for Numenera.

### Mutations
The mutant descriptor is not used. Anyone can have mutations, but they have costs.

When creating a character with mutations, first pick a different descriptor. Then work with your GM to exchange abilities from that descriptor for AXP. You may randomly roll mutations for standard cost, or chose mutations for a higher cost. During character creation you may use AXP from other sources to buy mutations.

1 powerful/distinctive mutation counts as an advancement. 
2 beneficial mutations also count as an advancement.

| Descriptor Ability Type  | AXP Cost  |
| -----------------------: | --------: |
| +2 to Pool               | 2         |
| +4 to Pool               | 4         |
| -2 to Pool               | -2        |
| -4 to Pool               | -4        |
| Narrow Skill             | 2         |
| Narrow Inability         | -2        |
| Broad Skill              | 4         |
| Broad Inability          | -4        |
| Unique Ability           | 4         |

| Mutation Type | AXP Cost (Random) | AXP Cost (Chosen) | Limit |
| ------------- | -----------------:| -----------------:| -----:|
| Cosmetic      | 0                 | 0                 | 4     |
| Beneficial    | 2                 | 3                 | 4     |
| Powerful      | 4                 | 6                 | 2     |
| Distinctive   | 4                 | 6                 | 2     |
| Harmful       | -4                | -2                | 2     |

Some mutations may need mechanical modifications if they impact character interactions.
